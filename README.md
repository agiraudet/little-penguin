# Little Penguin: Linux Kernel Development

**42 School project**

**Summary:** This project is based on the Eudyptula Challenge, a series of Linux kernel programming assignments aimed at familiarizing participants with kernel development practices.

## Introduction
This "challenge" offers a series of tasks in Linux kernel programming, starting from basic to advanced levels. Successful completion of the challenge demonstrates proficiency in kernel development.

## Objectives
| Assignment   | Objective                                                                                         |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assignment 00 | Build a custom kernel from Linus's latest git tree.                                                |
| Assignment 01 | Create a "Hello World" kernel module.                                                             |
| Assignment 02 | Modify the kernel's Makefile to include a custom version string.                                   |
